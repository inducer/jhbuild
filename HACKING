The jhbuild module consists of a package build framework, and a number
of configuration files for building various Gnome releases.  The rules
for checkins differ for each.

Modifications to the build framework should be submitted as bug
reports at http://bugzilla.gnome.org/ where they can be reviewed
before being committed.  The exception to this is build sheriff style
commits for small errors that prevent people from using jhbuild.  When
in doubt, submit a bug report.

The modulesets/ directory contains configuration files that describe
how to build various versions of Gnome.  The file gnomeXY.modules
contains rules needed to build the stable version X.Y of Gnome or the
development branch leading up to that version.  Changes of the
following types can be committed without approval:

  - Updating the branch tag for a module if it is incorrect for that
    Gnome release.

  - Updating to a new version of a tarball for tarball type
    defintions, provided the new version is appropriate for that Gnome
    release.

  - Adding a definition for a module that is part of the Gnome desktop,
    developer platform, 5th toe or bindings release, etc, but is
    missing from the module set.

  - Removal of module definitions where the associated module has been
    removed/obsoleted from the particular Gnome version (eg. acme was
    removed from gnome26 when it got integrated into control-center).

A number of modules that fall outside of a Gnome release but are
related to Gnome are also included in the module set.  This includes
software that may be under development and not ready for general use.

If you would like to add a module to one of the standard module sets,
submit a bug report as detailed above.  If it is Gnome related, it
will probably get accepted.

If your module is not Gnome related, it may get rejected.  Keep in
mind that jhbuild supports external module sets that are identified by
a full URI, which allows third parties to maintain module sets
independently.
